# Sklearn Extension for KNIME

This repository is the home of the [scikit-learn Extension]() for [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform). The extension provides a set of nodes for regression and classification.

The extension is mainly based on the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library.

[Here are some examples of workflows]() that use the extension.
